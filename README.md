# Flood Detection System using Arduino

A simple flood detection and alert system built with Arduino Uno, a water level sensor, and a GSM module.  
When water levels rise beyond a safe threshold, the system sends an SMS alert and makes a call to the registered mobile number, providing real-time flood warnings.
